This project is composed of Java, Java Swing, JDBC, and MySQL. 
At the start, a frame is opened which asks the user to create a bank account. 
If you are already a customer of the bank, you can use all the services provided by the bank. 
The services provided by the bank are money transfer and account closure. 
Other services include balance enquiry, withdrawal, and deposit of money. 
MySQL is used to save all the data about the customer and customer-related queries.
